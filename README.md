This resource provides the R code to reproduce key results described in Kinker, G.S., et al. Pan-cancer single-cell RNA-seq identifies recurring programs of cellular heterogeneity. Nat Genet 52, 1208â€“1218 (2020).

The analyses are divided into 6 main modules:
1. Identifying discrete and continuous patterns of expression heterogeneity within cell lines and human tumors.
2. Definying heterogeneity patterns that are shared between multiple cell lines and between multiple human tumors (i.e. recurrent heterogeneous programs, RHPs).
3-4. Comparying RHPs found in cell lines to RHPs found in human tumor samples.
5-6. Evaluating the association between expression and genetic heterogeneity in cell lines.
